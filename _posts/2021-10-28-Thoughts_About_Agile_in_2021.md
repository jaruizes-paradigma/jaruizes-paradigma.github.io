In this post I'm trying to explain my point of view and probably, it isn't the same of you or I'm wrong.

The idea of this post came from a debate in LinkedIn about the role of the Scrum Master and whether it's similar to a soccer coach or not (no, this post isn't about Scrum or the role of the Scrum Manager) and whether the Scrum Master has to know how to build software or not. To be honest, to me, the idea of Scrum Master being like a soccer coach, giving orders from the bench, deciding who is going to play and who isn't, setting the strategy,...,etc isn't my idea of Agile.

I have to say that I'm not a professional "Agile Coach" although I got some agile certifications and I like so much "the methodoly part" of building software. From my experience building software for many years, I realize that, **at least in the software sector**, we should return to the basics, "[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)", and put the focus, again, on building software instead of just following a method. 


<br />


# Return to the "The Agile Manifesto"

I'm not going to explain what is "[The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/)" but I recommend you to read it again. From this manifesto, I just would like to highlight some points:

- The title is "Manifesto for Agile Software Development", so it a manifesto from developers to people working in software. 

- The authors (17) are software developers (although not all of them studied a grade in computer)

- The first value is "***Individuals and interactions over processes and tools***" and all of them agreed to put it on the first position.

- Besides reading values and principles, read also the history. I like this paragraph: 

  > The Agile movement is not anti-methodology, in fact, many of us want to restore credibility to the word methodology. We want to restore a balance. 
  >
  > We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes. We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. Those who would brand proponents of XP or SCRUM or any of the other Agile Methodologies as "hackers" are ignorant of both the methodologies and the original definition of the term hacker.
  >
  >
  > ([Agile Manifesto - History](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html))



Ok, I get to the point, if the question is: "Should an Agile Coach/Scrum Master, working with development teams, has built software before?", in my opinion, "yes, it should be necessary". Why? Because building software is different to build houses, cars or whatever.... if you want to help someone to improve the way she/he pilots a plane, you'll need real practice and not only working in the simulator in order to give her/him better advices. 

For instance, someone, with no experience in building software, can not got to the "Agile School", getting a title and next say how a development team has to work. To me, the path to Agile Coach should start working in a development team and then, after some years of experiences (and failures), leading the team and try to improve the way to build better software and deliver more value.

> We are uncovering **better ways of developing software** by doing it and helping others do it
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Values](https://agilemanifesto.org/))

Obviously, there are more skills needed to lead how the way of working should be, but one of those skills, from my point of view, should be having experience building and delivering software. 

<br />

# We are here to building software

It's the truth. As a professional software developers or engineers, we are paid to build products, applications or tools using software. Clients want our software not the methods used to built it.

But, nowadays, **Agile is a business itself**. Some companies sell "agile frameworks", "agile coaches" or just certifications to other companies.There is a lot of marketing around those frameworks or certifications and every company wants to say that is doing Agile or showing how the teams are performing stand-up meetings or have many post-its everywhere:

![agile_car](/images/agile/coche.jpg)

Agile and its frameworks and certfications are now the business instead the software that they suppose to help to build. **If you think carefully about that, it hasn't sense.** 

Why? Because the original target (I want to believe it) wasn't to make Agile a business....**The target was (and is) building better software by improving the way to do it**, and as a consequence of that, better time-to-market, cost reduction associated to missunderstandings, risk minimization, early and continuos delivering and so on...

The target is show to the world the sotfware I build. Show to everyone the awesome software products you are building and how your business has improved and then, if you want, show "the agile you are" adding features or fixing failures or how your teams work. But, **first at all, show the product and the working code not the post-its or the cool meetings**

<br />

# Individuals and interactions: this is what matters

This the core of all: "individuals and interactions" means "working as a team". This sentence doesn't mean that you have to work using an specific methodology or having concrete tools. It does mean that you need good people that work together as a team, not as a group. I would like to explain this using the example of the salad versus "[gazpacho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazpacho)"

If your team work as a salad, you're not working as a real team. You are just working as a group of ingredients. In a salad, the chef puts the different ingredients together without mixing them. When you are eating a salad, all the ingredients are there but separately, and you manage how to mix the different ingredients and even, you can decide to not eating one of them because you don't like or it hasn't the right quality you expect. Sometimes you say "these tomatoes are great/bad", "this cucumber isn't good" and rarely, say something about the chef. The fault is always the ingredients

If your team works as a "gazpacho", you are really working as a team because success depends on the mix of everything. Some ingredients complement the others. The chef puts in some ingredients and makes a mixture. Everything is mixed. Perhaps the chef will put more of one ingredient and less of another to get a good flavor. When you eat a "gazpacho" you cannot decide which ingredient to eat and which not. And you will like (or not) the whole, not the parts. Everyone wins or everyone loses, including the chef. 

In a salad, interactions are managed by someone external who decide how to eat the salad. In a gazpacho, interactions are full because all the ingredients are mixed from the beginning, working as a whole and complementing some of them with others. 

This is how an agile team has to work. The method doesn't matter. What really matters is how team members interact each other and how one of them complementing others. One team wins, one team loses. And, in order to win, to get the target, the team will decide how to work depending on its context. If you, that are not going to be with the team, decide how it has to work, how they have to organize and which tools have to they use, maybe you are not easing the way...maybe you are putting stones in the way.

The key is that the team knows clearly what objetives it has to achieve (and when) and, then, let them to do their job.

# Do not copy models

I'm sure you know the Spotify model and you have heard terms like "tribes", chapter", "squads",... If you know more than about the model, you can read the paper "[Scaling Agile @Spotify](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf)". This picture, from that paper, summarizes the model:

![agile_car](/images/agile/spotify_model.jpg)

**Do you know that Spotify doesn't really use this model?** ** In the first page of the paper you'll find the following disclaimer:

![spotify_disclaimer](/images/agile/spotify_disclaimer.jpg)

Spotify had a goal, "turning the music business upside down", and worked to improve its way of working to achieve the goal. It was its context and its circumstances, not yours. They didn't copy the model, they created a new one taking some ideas from some frameworks and they tried to applied to its context.

![kent_beck_spotify](/images/agile/kent_beck_spotify.jpg)


**So, why are you try to copy it?** 

** Beside that, some people from Spotify say that "the Spotify model" never worked (you can find more details [here](https://www.jeremiahlee.com/posts/failed-squad-goals/)). 

In order to "the Spotify model" works in your company you need to copy more than its way of working, you need to copy all the organization and its business model or goals. And, by the way, getting the Spotify model shouldn't be a goal, your goal. Your goal should be improving time-to-market, reducing bugs,...,etc. 

![agile_attitude](/images/agile/spotify_copy.jpg)

For instance, do you really think that just performing a retrospective every two weeks using post-it to show what is working, what is not,....etc everyhing is going to be better? This is, again, put the focus on the process instead of in the results. Performing retrosprectives, plannings, whatever...isn't a goal.  and then, Spotify evolved that model according its context in every moment. 

If you can't (or you don't want to) perform the retro every two weeks or if you don't use post-its, it doesn't matter. What really matter is that your team (and your company) talks about how is working and how it could do better. If your team talks about that drinking some beers every friday, in the office every two weeks or at home every day, it doesn't matter. The important is knowing what could be improved and setting steps to try it and it that isn't the way, change the way.

In my opinion, being Agile also means having the possibility to implement different ways of working at all levels, from the top (company) to the bottom (teams), and evolve them whenever necessary according to each context and goals. For that reason, from a point of view, when a company decides to apply a "methodoloy framework" as a whole, deciding that all your teams are going to work using it, the company is really imposing a methodology that thinks is the best for everyone, every team, every department...Again, the methodology shouldn't be the goal. Let's return to the first value:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Values](https://agilemanifesto.org/))

# Industrial Agile

Sometimes I have the feeling that Agile has become a factory: "how many Scrum Masters do you need? Are you going to need someone knowing SAFe? Ok, perfect. I'll send you three of them next week"

Agile isn't something like programming in Java and get certified because you're going to use Java in the same way independently of the context but you can't use the same "Agile framework" independently of the context. You'll have to adapt the way of working according to the goals to achieve. Because of that, for instance, just having an Scrum certification isn't enough, because Scrum could not work well with some contexts or teams. 

Agile shouldn't be hiring a set of Scrum Masters or Agile coaches to explain to the teams how they have to work. Agile should be to allow teams to adopt the best way of working to achieve the objetives, whatever that way of working. I like so much how Martin Fowler talks about that:

> The point is, the team doing work decides how to do it. That is a fundamental agile principle. That even means if the team doesn't want to work in an agile way, then agile probably isn't appropriate in that context, and *[not using agile]* is the most agile way they can do things in some kind of strangely twisted world of logic. 
>
> ([Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html))

So, teams don't need an external figure like the Scrum Master or the Agile Coach trying to convince them to adopt a concrete way of working. Teams do need people to make it easy for them to interact with business people or the final user. Teams need people to help to remove silos. Teams do need people. Teams do need people to help them to manage dependencies with other teams,... All these things have to be managed in a different way depending on each company, each context. Because of that, Agile should not be industrialized. What works in a company could not work in other companies

Teams don't need "outsiders" to tell them how to work because that is, exclusively, a matter of the team and each team is different. Because of that, Agile should not be industrialized. What works in a team could not work in other teams. 

I don't need some certified Scrum Masters (although I also have the cerfication....) because if Scrum doesn't work well with my teams, what do I do with them? Do I have to fire them? This is another reason for me to say that the Scrum Master must be a role within the team rather than an "external" people and if Scrum doesn't work and the team decides to change to a way of working where there is no Scrum Master role, it's ok.

<br />

# Agile is having a plan to change it

Although you are practicing Agile you need a plan. Yes, in my opinion there is (should be) a plan to achive a goal. Maybe you are thinking, again, about this value of the manifesto:

> Responding to change over following a plan
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Values](https://agilemanifesto.org/))

**The key is that the plan can change because there are changes and being Agile is responding to them.** As a team you should always know "what the goal is" but, depending of the circunstances, "*how we are going to achieve the goal*" and "*when we are going to achieve the goal*", could change. 

> We plan, but recognize the limits of planning in a turbulent environment. 
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - History](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html))

For instance, when you decide where to go somewhere you have a plan to do it and, initially, you know more or less when you are going to arrive there. Maybe there isn't a formal plan but, in your head, you have a goal (or goals) and a plan to achive them. 

If, on your way to the goal, you find a road closed you'll change your path, but the goal is still the same although, you know you could arrive later. Then, an event more happens; your mother calls to ask to you if you can buy something she needs. You'll change your path again and you already know you are going to arrive later and you call to your wife/husband to notify the delay, at that moment in order to your wife/husband can react to the event.  

As a company, you should know where you want to go in a medium or long term, what you want to do with your business because you want to earn money because you have to pay the payrolls of your employees and also, get some benefits. Because life is hard, there are more players playing at the same game and they want to win, you'll have to adapt your plan continuously in order to provide the best product or service to your customers (and potential ones). That is being Agile.

> Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html))

Maybe you are thinking "having a plan at a company level is ok but I'm just working in a team.". Each team also should be a plan to achive the goals and respond to change updating that plan in order to manage changes and keeping providing value to the customer. The backlog is a plan to achive something (an MVP, for instance). The team should introduce changes in that backlog in order to react to unpredictable events, "feedback" (bugs, improvements,...) from users, managing risks, reducing technical debt,...,etc.

# Agile isn't going faster

Do you know the book "[Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time](https://www.amazon.es/Scrum-Doing-Twice-Work-Half/dp/1847941109/ref=asc_df_1847941109/?tag=googshopes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=66129295635&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=10053239917135273927&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=20296&hvtargid=pla-154607740875&psc=1)"? 

![agile_attitude](/images/agile/scrum_book.jpg)

Forget it. The title is false. **You are not going to "do twice the work in the half the time".**

Do you think that if you do Scrum, the amount of code needed to implement an application is going to be less than if you don't do Scrum? Do you think that you are going to find a good solution faster than if you don't use Scrum? I don't think so. 

Agile doesn't mean doing things faster. Agile means doing things better, maximizing value delivered when it has to be delivered. The amount of work is the same independently of the methodology.  The methodoloy can help you to understand well to your customer and receive sooner feedback in order to improve things. A methodology can help you to put focus on the important, the value delivered to the user. 

We can talk a lot about what is "value". In my opinion, "value" stands for doing what the final users need when they need. Agile isn't goingo to help you to get impossible deadlines. Agile can help to define a goal and to adopt the best way of working to achive the goal. 

Agile can help teams (and companies) to be concious that the way choosen isn't the right way and it have to be changed. Agile can help to avoid waste. 

<br/>

# Agile does includes documentation

I've heard many developers saying that they don't desing or document anything because they do Agile and they refer to this value:

> Working software over comprehensive documentation
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Values](https://agilemanifesto.org/))

And, of course, they also say that the best documentation is the code.

As I said at the beginning, if you read the history of the Agile Manifesto, you'll find the following sentence:

> We embrace modeling, but not in order to file some diagram in a dusty corporate repository. We embrace documentation, but not hundreds of pages of never-maintained and rarely-used tomes.
>
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - History](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html))

So, it's false you don't need design or documentation in Agile. The point is be practical. When we talk about documentation, having a lot of documents, not updated (maybe because its format isn't practical), isn't practical. Neither, having no documentation isn't practical. 

Do you imagine having to read some thousand of lines of code to know something about the system? Have you ever thought that some of those lines could be not-used code? And, if you don't know the language? How are you going to know how the end-to-end architecture is? 

Maybe you're thinking that someone knowing the company is going to explain everything to you but have you ever thought that, in our sector (SW), rotation level is too high? **When people come and go you need something more stable and of course, something practical that could be updated easily**

<br/>

# Agile is thinking more and coding less

Many people think that being Agile is starting to code as soon as posible, without desinging anything. It's a big error. 

**Design is the most important part building software**. It is always there, no matter if you use a paper or a tool but think, think a lot, before coding. To me, being Agile is coding only when I know what I have to do and only what is necessary. No more, no less. I try to follow this steps:

1. Listen and try to understand the problem (sometimes there is no problem...) or need and use cases. Try to respond "what (is the problem/need/use case)" and "why (is there a problem/is it really a need/do they need this use case....)". Ask as many times you need to know the context where you are going to work. 

2. Design efficiently keeping in mind the uses cases (remember YAGNI, keep it simple). Don't think in products, frameworks, tools, etc..Think about business, components, behaviours, interactions, data managed, patterns, concepts, requirements, domains, responsabillities and so on. Study alternatives. Think also in failure scenarios and design it. If you don't know the scenarios, return to step 1. Be agile. Don't guess. 

3. Try to assign products, frameworks, tools,...,etc keeping always in mind the context in which you are going to apply the solution. 

   This is very important. For instance, if you are thinking to implement an application using ReactJS but the most of the applications in that context are built using Angular, you should argue very well why to use React instead Angular. Think about the current knowkedge in that context, 

   Or for instance, if the budget is tight maybe you should eval free alternatives to some commercial products although these ones provide more features or better performance. Do you really need them? Maybe not.

4. Think how you are going to probe the solution(s), its parts and end-to-end. If you don't know how to test the solution you don't know what the problem is. Return to previous steps. Something isn't clear. 

5. Think how you are going to put in the solution in production (and how you are going to observe it, monitor it and evolve it) keeping in mind, again, the context. If we are designing a complex solution to deploy in production or a solution "not compliance" with the current production environment in that client/context, "Houston, we have a problem". So, the key is detecting it before throwing a line of code instead of when the code is ready to be deployed in production. Be agile. Return to previous steps. 

6. Have you think about risks and dependencies? Do you have alternatives? Be agile. Study risks and how you can manage them

7. Implement it (test & business code).

8. Deliver it

9. Receive and analyze feedback

10. Make decisions



Only step number 7 is related to code. Don't go directly to step 7. Be agile. Understand the problem or need and think about the best solution(s) in that context before coding. 

**Coding without understanding the problem is waste. The best code is the one that is not written.**

<br/>

# Agile is delivering, delivering and delivering functional software

> Working software is the primary measure of progress.
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html))

When we talk about "working software", we talk about software being used by the user. If the user hasn't used the software we've built, the software hasn't been delivered and then, the features associated to that code isn't finished although we've passed tests. 

Keep in mind three fundamental truths: 

1. Reality exceeds the fiction. Everything will fail anytime
2. The reason isn't knowledge yet but, in production environments, usually things work different that in previous environments. The sooner you detect this kind of "differences" the better software you'll delivered next times
3. Users will find more bugs than you. 

So, if we mark tasks as done without being accepted by the user, we are fooling yourself and making the same mistakes as the traditional methodologies setting all the tasks to 90%... 

> Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html))

Build, deliver frequently, receive feedback from the users and improve. This is the process. Simple.  

If you use Jira, Jenkins, 2-weeks sprints, Scrum, the most recent frontend framework, Kubernetes,whatever... it doesn't matter if you don't deliver, continuosly, working software to the final user. 

How you can deliver frequently? Design, technical excellence, KISS, YAGNI and CI/CD are your best friends

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
>
> ([Agile Manifesto - Principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html))



<br />

# To be or not to be Agile

In my opinion, "to be or not to be" Agile, it doesn't matter. As I said before, the important is focusing on doing things (software) well and delivering them when the user expect them. Simple.

For instance, if we read the Scrum Guide, we found the [following point](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html#end-note):

> The Scrum framework, as outlined herein, is immutable. While implementing only parts of Scrum is possible, the result is not Scrum. Scrum exists only in its entirety and functions well as a container for other techniques, methodologies, and practices.



The Scrum Guide also sets a role to guaranty that the methodology is applied like the guide says:

> The Scrum Master is accountable for establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide. They do this by helping everyone understand Scrum theory and practice, both within the Scrum Team and the organization.
>
> The Scrum Master is accountable for the Scrum Team’s effectiveness. They do this by enabling the Scrum Team to improve its practices, within the Scrum framework.

**Don't you think, again, that this is putting the focus mostly on the process?** **It doesn't care whether the result is Scrum or not because, again, the goal isn't the process. The goal is building better software, the software that the users expect**

<br />

# Agile is an attitude

I would like to finish this post with this quote from one of the signatories of The Agile Manifesto:

![agile_attitude](/images/agile/agile_attitude.jpg)

<br />

So, I hope you liked it, whether you agree or not with my vision. That's all folks.
